Removed health penalty and added +25hp bonus. Added an extra 2 bullets to each shot, added movement speed penalty when equipped (its heavy afterall)
// V5.3.5 Herewegoagain, another balance change, should reduce the fps hit as well when multiple heavies are using it, keeps similar/same constant firing time and ttk
// V5.3.8 Added negative z force attribute, anything in the air will be forced down to the ground
